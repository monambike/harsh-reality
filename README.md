# HARSH REALITY

Harsh reality is a game that will make you see that things are not the way we want.
The world is cruel, the world is brutal, the world is what it is. Life may be happy, but also cruel and brutal, and as happinness is unavoidable and  is out of our control and will ever be, brutality and cruelity will always be.

My first unity 2d game focusing on combat and ambient with purple colors. Starring as the main character Emma.
